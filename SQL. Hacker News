Oh no! While we are looking at the power users, some users are
rickrolling — tricking readers into clicking on a link to a funny video
and claiming that it links to information about coding.
The url of the video is:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ

How many times has each offending user posted this link?
