Howdy! It’s your first day as a TechCrunch reporter. 
Your first task is to write an article on the rising trends in the startup world.
To get you started with your research, your boss emailed you a project.sqlite file 
that contains a table called startups. It is a portfolio of some of the biggest names in the industry.
Write queries with aggregate functions to retrieve some interesting insights about these companies.
