/* 
Howdy! Itâ€™s your first day as a TechCrunch reporter. 
Your first task is to write an article on the rising trends in the startup world.
To get you started with your research, your boss emailed you a project.sqlite file 
that contains a table called startups. It is a portfolio of some of the biggest names in the industry.
Write queries with aggregate functions to retrieve some interesting insights about these companies.

-- Getting started, take a look at the startups table
SELECT *
FROM startups;

-- Calculates the total number of companies in the table
SELECT COUNT(name) AS 'Number_of_companies'
FROM startups;

-- We want to know the total value of all companies in this table
SELECT SUM(valuation) AS 'Total_value'
FROM startups;

-- What is the highest amount raised by a startup?
SELECT MAX(raised) AS 'MAX_raised'
FROM startups;
